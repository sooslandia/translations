  "ModeSelectionFormTestOfSkillModeInfo": "Trial of mastery.\nIn this mode, you will need to apply all accumulated experience, demonstrating exceptional skill in navigating true chaos.\nThe number of objects on the field is slightly reduced compared to the regular mode, and you only earn seventy percent of the original point values.\nSkills are disabled, and bonus points are not awarded for perfect strikes or bounces off the ceiling.\nAdditionally, special objects like mines are absent from the field.\nThe leader and time auras do not affect this mode.\nThe maximum duration for continuing hit and object destruction streaks is reduced to two seconds, instead of the usual six.\nInstead of one ball, you start with three.\nThey need to be thrown onto the field as quickly as possible, as the penalty for holding onto the ball works as usual.\nPut all your effort into avoiding frequent bounces of the balls off the floor, as the penalty will increase rapidly.\nThe balls can also collide with each other, causing complete chaos.\nIt’s also important to note that the more points you accumulate, the higher the penalty for the balls bouncing off the floor becomes.\nFrom time to time, items will appear on the ground that you can activate.\nYou can activate items by pressing the X key (applies to the default controls configuration).\nThis mode features eight types of items:\n1. Points Multiplier: When activated, it gives you a bonus to the points you earn for fifteen seconds.\n2. Rocket Launcher: When activated, it launches a rocket upward, which flies to the center of the field and explodes, destroying nearby objects.\n3. Creator's Item: When activated, it creates ten to fifteen objects on the field.\n4. Mass Immateriality: When activated, it applies the Immateriality effect to all balls on the field for fifteen seconds.\n5. Mass Superelasticity: When activated, it applies the Superelasticity effect to all balls on the field for ten seconds.\n6. Penalty Item: When activated, you lose fifteen percent of your current score.\n7. Wooden Puppet: When activated, a wooden puppet appears at either the left or right boundary of the field, aiming to reach the opposite boundary.\nYour task is to destroy the puppet by following it and hitting it with the bat.\nOnce the puppet is destroyed, you will receive a bonus equal to thirty-five percent of your current score, and an item will appear at the location of its destruction, which can be activated to receive five planks.\nIf you fail to destroy the puppet before it reaches the opposite boundary, one of two events will occur:\n1. If the puppet took no damage or only minor damage, you will receive a thirty-five percent penalty to your current score.\n2. If the puppet took significant damage, when it reaches the boundary, you will receive a bonus to your score proportional to the damage dealt to it, but not exceeding twenty-five percent. Additionally, an item will appear at the field boundary, which can be activated to receive some planks.\nEach event has its own sound, which can be listened to, along with all other additional sounds of the mode, by selecting the relevant option in the reference.\n8. Boards: When activated, you receive a certain number of boards.\nYou can check the current number of boards by pressing alt+z, and throw one board upward with z (this applies only to the default key configuration).\nAfter being thrown, the board flies upwards, knocking objects down along the way.\nEach type of item has its own characteristic sound, helping you identify which item is on the field.\nIf you miss three items in a row, you will receive a penalty of twenty-five percent of your current score.\nYou can check how many items you've missed in the pause menu.\nAt the end of the game session, you will receive not coins, but a new currency - red orbs.\nBy spending this currency in the in-game store, you can either acquire new abilities or improve the conditions of this mode.",

After it stops, you will be able to hit it again.\nWith each successful hit, the streak increases, allowing you to earn more points with subsequent hits.\nIf no hits are made within a certain time frame, the streak will reset.\nThe streak has a limit, after which it will stop growing, but the points will continue to be earned with the same bonus until the streak is reset.\nAt the top of the field is a bar that limits the ball's flight.\nOccasionally, for a few seconds, there will be an opportunity to activate one of six effects.\nTo activate an effect, the ball must hit the bar.\n1. Chaotic Movement: When activated, the goal will move constantly in random horizontal directions for fifteen seconds. The ability to hit the goal with the ball in this mode is unlimited.\n2. Stopper: When activated, the goal’s movement will be blocked for fifteen seconds. After hitting the goal, it will stay in the same position.\n3. Point Multiplier: When activated, you will receive a bonus to the points you earn for fifteen seconds.\n4. Elevator: When activated, the goal will rise closer to the bar for fifteen seconds.\n5. Rocket: When activated, a rocket will be launched toward the goal. After the rocket hits the target, you will receive several times more points than for a regular ball hit.\n6. Electric discharge: When activated, an electric discharge will be fired at the character. If it hits the character, they will be paralyzed for ten seconds. However, if you manage to avoid the charge, you will receive a bonus of five percent of your current score.\nEach effect has its unique sound.\nAll additional sounds of the mode can be listened to by selecting the corresponding option at the end of the reference.\nIf you miss three activation opportunities in a row, you will be penalized by twenty-five percent of your current score.\nYou can check how many activations you have missed in the pause menu.\nAt the end of the game session, you will receive not coins, but a new currency - blue orbs.\nBy spending this currency in the in-game store, you can either acquire a new skill or an object, or improve the conditions of this mode.",
