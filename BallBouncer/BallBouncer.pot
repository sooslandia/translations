"The number of objects on the field is slightly reduced compared to the "
"regular mode, and you only earn seventy percent of the original point "
"values.\n"
"Skills are disabled, and bonus points are not awarded for perfect strikes or "
"bounces off the ceiling.\n"
"Additionally, special objects like mines are absent from the field.\n"
"The leader and time auras do not affect this mode.\n"
"The maximum duration for continuing hit and object destruction streaks is "
"reduced to two seconds, instead of the usual six.\n"
"Instead of one ball, you start with three.\n"
"They need to be thrown onto the field as quickly as possible, as the penalty "
"for holding onto the ball works as usual.\n"
"Put all your effort into avoiding frequent bounces of the balls off the "
"floor, as the penalty will increase rapidly.\n"
"The balls can also collide with each other, causing complete chaos.\n"
"It’s also important to note that the more points you accumulate, the higher "
"the penalty for the balls bouncing off the floor becomes.\n"
"From time to time, items will appear on the ground that you can activate.\n"
"You can activate items by pressing the X key (applies to the default "
"controls configuration).\n"
"This mode features eight types of items:\n"
"1. Points Multiplier: When activated, it gives you a bonus to the points you "
"earn for fifteen seconds.\n"
"2. Rocket Launcher: When activated, it launches a rocket upward, which flies "
"to the center of the field and explodes, destroying nearby objects.\n"
"3. Creator's Item: When activated, it creates ten to fifteen objects on the "
"field.\n"
"4. Mass Immateriality: When activated, it applies the Immateriality effect "
"to all balls on the field for fifteen seconds.\n"
"5. Mass Superelasticity: When activated, it applies the Superelasticity "
"effect to all balls on the field for ten seconds.\n"
"6. Penalty Item: When activated, you lose fifteen percent of your current "
"score.\n"
"7. Wooden Puppet: When activated, a wooden puppet appears at either the left "
"or right boundary of the field, aiming to reach the opposite boundary.\n"
"Your task is to destroy the puppet by following it and hitting it with the "
"bat.\n"
"Once the puppet is destroyed, you will receive a bonus equal to thirty-five "
"percent of your current score, and an item will appear at the location of "
"its destruction, which can be activated to receive five planks.\n"
"If you fail to destroy the puppet before it reaches the opposite boundary, "
"one of two events will occur:\n"
"1. If the puppet took no damage or only minor damage, you will receive a "
"thirty-five percent penalty to your current score.\n"
"2. If the puppet took significant damage, when it reaches the boundary, you "
"will receive a bonus to your score proportional to the damage dealt to it, "
"but not exceeding twenty-five percent. Additionally, an item will appear at "
"the field boundary, which can be activated to receive some planks.\n"
"Each event has its own sound, which can be listened to, along with all other "
"additional sounds of the mode, by selecting the relevant option in the "
"reference.\n"
"8. Boards: When activated, you receive a certain number of boards.\n"
"You can check the current number of boards by pressing alt+z, and throw one "
"board upward with z (this applies only to the default key configuration).\n"
"After being thrown, the board flies upwards, knocking objects down along the "
"way.\n"
"Each type of item has its own characteristic sound, helping you identify "
"which item is on the field.\n"
"If you miss three items in a row, you will receive a penalty of twenty-five "
"percent of your current score.\n"
"You can check how many items you've missed in the pause menu.\n"
"At the end of the game session, you will receive not coins, but a new "
"currency - red orbs.\n"
"By spending this currency in the in-game store, you can either acquire new "
"abilities or improve the conditions of this mode."

"Skills are disabled, and bonus points are not awarded for perfect strikes.\n"
"However, the leader and time auras work without restriction.\n"
"The goal is located at the bottom of the field and emits a special looping "
"sound.\n"
"You need to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the goal.\n"
"After a successful hit, you will earn points, and the goal will start moving "
"in a random horizontal direction. After it stops, you will be able to hit it "
"again.\n"
"With each successful hit, the streak increases, allowing you to earn more "
"points with subsequent hits.\n"
"If no hits are made within a certain time frame, the streak will reset.\n"
"The streak has a limit, after which it will stop growing, but the points "
"will continue to be earned with the same bonus until the streak is reset.\n"
"At the top of the field is a bar that limits the ball's flight.\n"
"Occasionally, for a few seconds, there will be an opportunity to activate "
"one of six effects.\n"
"To activate an effect, the ball must hit the bar.\n"
"1. Chaotic Movement: When activated, the goal will move constantly in random "
"horizontal directions for fifteen seconds. The ability to hit the goal with "
"the ball in this mode is unlimited.\n"
"2. Stopper: When activated, the goal’s movement will be blocked for fifteen "
"seconds. After hitting the goal, it will stay in the same position.\n"
"3. Point Multiplier: When activated, you will receive a bonus to the points "
"you earn for fifteen seconds.\n"
"4. Elevator: When activated, the goal will rise closer to the bar for "
"fifteen seconds.\n"
"5. Rocket: When activated, a rocket will be launched toward the goal. After "
"the rocket hits the target, you will receive several times more points than "
"for a regular ball hit.\n"
"6. Electric discharge: When activated, an electric discharge will be fired "
"at the character. If it hits the character, they will be paralyzed for ten "
"seconds. However, if you manage to avoid the charge, you will receive a "
"bonus of five percent of your current score.\n"
"Each effect has its unique sound.\n"
"All additional sounds of the mode can be listened to by selecting the "
"corresponding option at the end of the reference.\n"
"If you miss three activation opportunities in a row, you will be penalized "
"by twenty-five percent of your current score.\n"
