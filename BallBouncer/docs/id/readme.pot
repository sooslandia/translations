"You need to strive to always make perfect strikes, as you will be awarded "
"bonus points for them. A perfect strike occurs if the ball bounces off the "
"ground only once. For the second and subsequent bounces, you will lose "
"points. The more the ball bounces off the ground, the more points you lose. "
"Therefore, try to hit the ball up as quickly as possible. Standing in one "
"place for a long time is also not worth it, since if you don’t move for ten "
"or more seconds, you will also lose points. At the beginning of the game, do "
"not hold the ball in your hands for long, as each second of holding the ball "
"will result in an increasing penalty. The same applies to the caught ball. "
"For the fifth and subsequent misses with the bat a penalty is assessed. For "
"colliding the ball with an object, as well as for destroying the object, you "
"get points. If the ball bounces off the ceiling, you will also get bonus "
"points. After colliding with an object or destroying it, a streak begins. "
"There are separate streaks for collisions and destructions. Each subsequent "
"collision or destruction brings more points. But if the streak did not last "
"more than six seconds, it is reset. The same applies to ball bounces from "
"the ceiling. After making a perfect strike, a streak also begins. For each "
"new perfect strike you make, you get significantly more points than the "
"previous one. If the ball bounces off the floor more than once, the streak "
"ends and you have to start over. Once destroyed, objects will fall to the "
"ground, causing inconvenience with loud sounds and adding to the chaos."
