% "Ball bouncer" documentation

This help file explains how to navigate the menus and screens of the application, and also describes the gameplay in detail with most of the nuances. If you want to figure it out yourself, we recommend that you immediately go and familiarize yourself with the table of control keys.

## System requirements

64 bit windows 10 or later.

64 bit ubuntu 22 or later.

## First steps

When the game runs for the first time you will have to select a language. After making your selection, a welcome screen will appear. As soon as you make your selection our logo will start playing. You can skip it by pressing the enter key. After the logo is skipped or finishes playing you will be taken to the main menu of the game. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with its contents.
If you want to learn the game sounds, you need to select “Settings” in the main menu, then on the “General” tab click on the corresponding button.
On the “Sound” tab you can adjust the volume of music and sounds, change the sound panning mode And disable some alerts. on the "Behavior" tab.

The game has a training mode where you can spend unlimited time and where all penalties are disabled. In this mode, a sound will be played when you can hit the ball, which you can listen to in the learn sounds menu. The sound will play when the ball has bounced at least once off the floor to teach you to sense the moment for the perfect strike. In training mode, game statistics are not collected, and points are not scored.
If you don't like the sound of the ball, you can change it in the settings, on the "Sound" tab, choosing from five proposed options. This can be done directly during the game by going to the settings from the pause menu. The ball sound will change as soon as you unpause the game.

## Navigation

Moving through menus is done by using the up and down arrows. Enter selects an item, while home and end keys do their respective job by setting you on the first or last menu item.

Screen navigation(settings, shop, profile, etc.),: tab/shift+tab forward/back, activate controls by pressing enter or spacebar. Move through the lists with up and down arrows, change the value of the sliders with arrows. Tab selection is done by pressing left/right arrow keys.

On the shop screen, by pressing enter on the item you have selected, you can open reference information that describes this item.
In your profile, on the "Statistics" tab, by pressing enter on a list item you can receive a reward, if available.
On the “Skills” tab, by clicking on an item, you can get detailed information about the skill.

All menus and screens, excluding the main menu and the last game results menu, can be closed with the escape key.

## Game process

### How to play

After selecting “Start game” in the main menu, the starting countdown will begin. You will then be able to control the character.
At the beginning of the game the character is in the center of the field. You can move it using the left and right arrows. Initially the camera is in the field-centered view, but you can switch it to first person view and back by pressing v. By pressing the C key, you will hear a sound positioned at the character's location. This will help you better understand your character whereabouts when trying to hit the ball. With the left or right shift you can set the direction the character is facing. When moving, the facing direction is set automatically.

First of all, you need to throw the ball so that it appears on the playing field. You can do this by pressing the f key.
After the ball is on the field, you will hear a tone which will move left and right, indicating movement of the ball in the horizontal plane. The tone's pitch and volume will also change, indicating vertical ball movement. Decreasing volume and rising pitch mean that the ball is moving upwards, while increasing volume and lowering pitch mean the opposite.

There are two types of throw:

+ Normal. Performed by pressing the f key. The ball begins to fly in an arc in the direction the character is facing.
+ Vertical. Performed by holding down the alt key and pressing f. The ball starts flying along the vertical axis, but also moves slightly along the horizontal axis in the direction the character is facing.

The goal of the game is to destroy as many objects as possible, gaining points along the way. The ball always tends to fall down, and you need to hit it back with a bat.

The ball can be hit in two ways:

+ Spacebar key. In this case, the ball will receive a strong horizontal impulse in the direction the character is facing.
+ Hold down the alt key and press spacebar. The ball will receive a strong vertical impulse, maintaining a horizontal flight direction regardless of the character's facing.

You can only hit the ball while being near it. After each swing of the bat, the character restores the force of the blow. Once it is fully restored, you will hear an alert, the sound of which can be heard in the learn sounds menu. You can also toggle the sound of successful bat hits in the options on the behavior tab.

You need to strive to always make perfect strikes, as you will be awarded bonus points for them. A perfect strike occurs if the ball bounces off the ground only once. For the second and subsequent bounces, you will lose points. The more the ball bounces off the ground, the more points you lose. Therefore, try to hit the ball up as quickly as possible.
Standing in one place for a long time is also not worth it, since if you don’t move for ten or more seconds, you will also lose points.
At the beginning of the game, do not hold the ball in your hands for long, as each second of holding the ball will result in an increasing penalty. The same applies to the caught ball.
For the fifth and subsequent misses with the bat a penalty is assessed.
For colliding the ball with an object, as well as for destroying the object, you get points. If the ball bounces off the ceiling, you will also get bonus points.
After colliding with an object or destroying it, a streak begins. There are separate streaks for collisions and destructions. Each subsequent collision or destruction brings more points. But if the streak did not last more than six seconds, it is reset. The same applies to ball bounces from the ceiling. After making a perfect strike, a streak also begins. For each new perfect strike you make, you get significantly more points than the previous one. If the ball bounces off the floor more than once, the streak ends and you have to start over.
Once destroyed, objects will fall to the ground, causing inconvenience with loud sounds and adding to the chaos.

During the game, you can watch not only the entire picture of the playing field, but also switch to the ball watch mode. To activate this mode, hold down the G key. Ball Watch mode will be active as long as you hold G and will turn off as soon as you release it.
The game can be paused by pressing the escape key. When activated, you will be taken to the pause menu, where you can see the time until the end of the gaming session, the number of points scored and other information. You can also access the settings from the pause menu, or interrupt the game.
Alternatively, press t to see the time and p to see the points during the game.

If you allow your points to drop to minus one thousand, the gaming session will end early. Coins will not be credited, but you do not lose anything else.
A gaming session lasts five minutes. This time can be increased by improving the time aura in the profile.
After the game session ends, a sound animation of coins being added will begin playing, which can be skipped by pressing the enter key.
Then the last game results menu  will open, where you can find out how many points were ultimately scored and coins received. After closing the menu by pressing enter, you may be shown a notification about an available reward for reaching a statistic milestone. The display of the results menu for the last game and notifications about available rewards can be disabled in the settings, on the “Behavior” tab.

The game also has skills that are fully described in the game. To use a skill during the game, you need to assign it to one of ten slots. Assigning is done in your profile, on the “Skills” tab. Slots are accessed using keys from 1 (first slot) to 0 (tenth slot).

In the store you can unlock the mechanics of jumping and catching the ball. These two mechanics are also fully described in the game, including the keys to use. They are also present in the table of controls.
