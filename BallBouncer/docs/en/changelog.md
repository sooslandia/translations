   - Your configuration file is located in the user data folder (userData) and is called keyConfig.json. You can share your configuration with other people.

   - Recordings are saved in the recordings folder, located in the user data folder (userData) and have a .sgr extension. The recording file can be renamed if necessary and shared with other people.
